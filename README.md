This Repo presents an initial interactive prototype of an AR‑based learning application, designed to validate interaction flows and learning logic prior to full AR implementation in Unity


**Description**

ARLA is an educational mobile application that uses Augmented Reality (AR) to support students in learning algebra through active, step‑by‑step interaction rather than passive equation solving.

Instead of functioning as a traditional solver, ARLA requires students to apply algebraic operations themselves, while the system provides validation and feedback. This approach emphasizes conceptual understanding, reasoning, and learning outcomes.

**Learning Objective**

- The primary objective of ARLA is to improve students’ understanding of linear equations by:
  
- Encouraging deliberate, step‑by‑step problem solving
  
- Visualizing equality and balance through spatial metaphors
  
- Reinforcing correct algebraic reasoning via immediate feedback

**Project Scope — Initial Software Demo**

This submission represents the initial software demo of ARLA.

At this stage, the focus is on:

User interaction flow

Learning logic and feedback mechanisms

UI/UX design decisions

Clear definition of how AR will be integrated in the final application

To achieve this, the experience is presented as an interactive Figma prototype, which validates usability and pedagogical structure before full AR implementation in Unity.

Augmented Reality Integration (Core to the App)
Augmented Reality is a core component of ARLA.

In the final implementation:

The application will be developed using Unity

AR Foundation and ARCore will be used for plane detection and object placement

Algebraic elements (balance scale, variables, constants) will appear as AR objects anchored to real‑world surfaces

Users will interact using touch‑based input combined with AR visualization

The current prototype focuses on designing:

AR interaction overlays

Learning flow within the AR environment

Feedback and validation logic

These directly inform the Unity AR implementation.

Prototype Overview (Figma)

Scene 1 — Setup & Assessment

Equation input and problem selection

Scene 2 — AR Learning Experience

Immediate feedback after each action

Final solution state and learning summary

Measuring Learning Outcomes
Learning effectiveness is measured using:

Pre‑question versus post‑interaction understanding

Correct and incorrect algebraic steps taken

Student ability to independently complete the solution

This ensures the application prioritizes learning outcomes, not just answer accuracy.
